# Security and privacy

This package installs agent guidance and a native role. Guidance, file ownership and Git worktrees are not operating-system security boundaries. Existing sandbox, approval and repository restrictions continue to apply.

Installation does not run inference. A later delegated task sends its selected context and tool outputs to the configured provider. Obtain the appropriate authorization for private repositories and minimize shared context.

Never paste provider credentials into assistant chat. A package install does not
authorize `subagents certify`, `test-model --live`, smoke tests or other paid
inference probes.

Never publish authentication files, API keys, installation receipts, instruction
backups or unredacted task/provider logs. Synthetic test credentials in this
repository are deliberately fake.

For a suspected vulnerability, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository when the maintainer has enabled it. If unavailable, open a minimal issue requesting a private contact without exploit details, secrets or private logs. Do not use public issues to transmit sensitive evidence. No response-time guarantee is currently offered.

Useful reports include the package/client/Python version, affected behavior and a synthetic reproduction. Preserve security checks while investigating; do not disable approval controls to make a test pass.
